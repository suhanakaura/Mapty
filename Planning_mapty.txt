Planning a project :
Planning steps:
1. user stories:a description of the application's funtionality from user's perspective.All userstories 
put together describe entire application

common format: as a [type of user](who?), i want [an action](what?) so that [a benefit](why?) 

=> as a user, i want to log my running workouts with location, distance,time,pace and steps/minute,so
i can keep a log of all my running

=> as a user, i want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance,time,speed and elevation gain,so
i can keep a log of all my cycling

=> as a user, i want to see all my workouts at glance,so i can easily track my progress over time 

=> as a user, i want to also see my workouts on a map , so i can easily check where i workout the most

=> as a user, i want to see all my workouts when i leave the app and come back later, so that i can keep
using there app over time


2. features:
=>map where the user clicks to add a new workout (best way to get loaction coordinates)(2)
=>geolocation to display map at current location(more user friendly)(1)
=>form to input distance,time,pace,steps/minute(3)

=>form to input distance,time,speed,elevation gain(4)

=>display all workouts in a list(5)

=>display all workouts on a map(6)

=>store workout data in the browser using local storage api (7)
=>on page reload, read the saved data from local storage and display.(8)
=>move map to workout location on click (9)
